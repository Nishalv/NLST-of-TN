Change in Night Land Surface Temperature (NLST) of Tamil Nadu over two decades

🌆 Why Night LST?
Night LST is an excellent indicator of land surface temperature variations (learn more: https://lnkd.in/gZGxNaJM).

🌏 Data and Processing:
I utilized the MODIS data product, specifically MOD11A1 V6.1, which provides daily land surface temperature and emissivity data at a 1200 x 1200 kilometer grid resolution. 
The study period focused on the summer months across Tamil Nadu, with the past and present year data (2000 to 2005 & 2018 to 2023).

🛰 Leveraging Technology:
Arithmetic operations were performed using GoogleEarthEngine to generate the resulting layers for further analysis, downloaded for in-depth study.
One of the research goals is to derive heat vulnerability at the Block level. This will allow for targeted improvements based on the results. 
All statistical analyses are being conducted using the QGIS platform.
